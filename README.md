Dive into Go internals!

# Introduction

This project is the second version to [go internals v1](https://github.com/hitzhangjie/go-internals).
- version 1, just serves the CSV data exported from my Notion reading list.
- version 2, will re-arrange the content in an EBook manner, and the content isn't limited to my own reading list. Actually I welcome more contributions from you.

And, this EBook will always be FREE. Knowledge should be shared!

# Contribution

If you want to add more articles:
- content/posts/: if you don't know how to organize the articles, put it here
- content/docs/: if you know clearly which topic this article belongs to, put it into relevant directory hierarchy. don't forget to run `toc > SUMMARY.md` to update the catelogue.

ps: you can find the utility `toc` here, [hitzhangjie/toc](https://github.com/hitzhangjie/toc].
