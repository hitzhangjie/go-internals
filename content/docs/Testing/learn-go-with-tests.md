# Let's Summarize

通过测试来学习go的使用，掌握tdd测试驱动开发模式。

tdd遵循如下开发模式：
- write a test
- make the compiler pass
- run test, see that it fails and check the error message is meaningful
- write enough code to make the test pass
- refactor

tdd遵循上述流程的意义：
- write a failing test and see it fail so we know we have written a relevant test for our requirements and seen that it produces an easy to understand description of the failure
- writing the smallest amount of code to make it pass so we know we have working software
- then refactor, backed with the safety of our tests to ensure we have well-crafted code that is easy to work with

red、green、refactor：
throughout this book， we have emphasised the tdd process of:
- red: write a test & watch it fail
- green: write the minimal amount of code to make it work
- and then refactor
