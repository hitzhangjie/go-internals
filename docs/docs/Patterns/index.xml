      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s Summarize #  We started with asynchronous patterns, which deal with goroutines. Then, we looked at condition variables, which sometimes deal with resources.
Now, let&amp;quot;s put them together. The Worker Pool is a pattern that treats a set of goroutines as resources.
Just a note on terminology: in other languages the pattern is usually called a “thread pool”, but in Go we&amp;quot;re working with goroutines, so we just call them workers.</description>
